Search engine written in .NET Core

This project began back in 2002 as a commercial search engine from Daxat, Inc. written in C# for the Microsoft .NET Framework 1.0.
It seems only fitting that it resurfaces as a .NET Core 1.0 project.

The initial commit to the repository represents the final commercial code for Daxat, Inc.'s "Entensible Search Server 2005," often
referred to as ESS or ESS 2005. By the time of this release, it was built on .NET Framework 1.1.
