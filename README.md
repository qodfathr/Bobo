# Bobo
Search engine written in .NET Core

This project began back in 2002 as a commercial search engine from Daxat, Inc. written in C# for the Microsoft .NET Framework 1.0.
It seems only fitting that it resurfaces as a .NET Core 1.0 project.

The initial commits to the repository represents the final commercial code for Daxat, Inc.'s "Entensible Search Server 2005," often
referred to as ESS or ESS 2005. By the time of this release, it was built on .NET Framework 1.1.

You'll probably want to start with the [overview](overview.md).

Read the [development blog](http://stufftoddknows.com/tag/bobo/).

Note that most of the interesting work is happening in [other branches](https://github.com/qodfathr/Bobo/branches).
