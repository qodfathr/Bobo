  "body": "# Bobo\r\nSearch engine written in .NET Core\r\n\r\nThis project began back in 2002 as a commercial search engine from Daxat, Inc. written in C# for the Microsoft .NET Framework 1.0.\r\nIt seems only fitting that it resurfaces as a .NET Core 1.0 project.\r\n\r\nThe initial commits to the repository represents the final commercial code for Daxat, Inc.'s \"Entensible Search Server 2005,\" often\r\nreferred to as ESS or ESS 2005. By the time of this release, it was built on .NET Framework 1.1.\r\n\r\nYou'll probably want to start with the [overview](https://github.com/qodfathr/Bobo/blob/master/overview.md) to better understand the architecture of the solution. However, it's very important that you understand the purpose of this project -- the world does not need another search engine, even one as cool as this one. This code is being migrated from .NET Framework 1.0/1.1 to .NET Core 1.0 as an education exercise to show the degree of effort to port 'legacy' .NET Framework code to .NET Core.\r\n\r\nRead the [development blog](http://stufftoddknows.com/tag/bobo/).\r\n\r\nNote that if you are looking at master, most of the interesting work is happening in [other branches](https://github.com/qodfathr/Bobo/branches).\r\n",
