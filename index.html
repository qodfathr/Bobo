<p>Search engine written in .NET Core</p>

<p>This project began back in 2002 as a commercial search engine from <a href="http://stufftoddknows.com">Todd Mancini</a>'s start up Daxat, Inc. written in C# for the Microsoft .NET Framework 1.0.
It seems only fitting that it resurfaces as a .NET Core 1.0 project.</p>

<p>The initial commits to the repository represents the final commercial code for Daxat, Inc.'s "Entensible Search Server 2005," often
referred to as ESS or ESS 2005. By the time of this release, it was built on .NET Framework 1.1.</p>

<p>You'll probably want to start with the <a href="https://github.com/qodfathr/Bobo/blob/master/overview.md">overview</a> to better understand the architecture of the solution. However, it's very important that you understand the purpose of this project -- the world does not need another search engine, even one as cool as this one. This code is being migrated from .NET Framework 1.0/1.1 to .NET Core 1.0 as an education exercise to show the degree of effort to port 'legacy' .NET Framework code to .NET Core.</p>
